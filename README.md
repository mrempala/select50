Different algorithms for selecting the 50 smallest integers out of 1 million

Code in vector assumes that the integers will be given as a vector.

Code in stream assumes that the integers will be given as a file stream.

Value of the integers can range from 0 to 1 billion. Values of the integers follow a uniform random distribution (all values are equally likely to occur and can repeat).
